```

in a terminal of your choice.

# Usage

Directory **must** contain the following:

- input (dir)
- output (dir)
- frame.png

Note: **Images must be of size `375 x 812` (3x export for iPhone frame in Adobe XD)**. Place images in `input` and run the script.

If false positives are detected by your AV due to creation of folders, turn off AV temporarily.
